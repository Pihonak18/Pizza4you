# Technologies used for ratings page:

I used JS and Jquery to create the restaurant names, comment section and interaction for the user to vote using pizza slices. When the user selects each empty slice, it wil change to a colored "full" slice of pizza. The user can select as many as he or she would like to vote on their favorite place or leave a comment about each place. The rating is stored in local storage.

# Technologies used for main page and contact page:

We used HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.


# Technologies used for Pizza Map page: 

We used the Google Maps API for the pizza map page so you are able to click on the map and find the pizza places information. You can zoom in and out and change views on the google map.

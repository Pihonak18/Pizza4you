# Pizza4you

MS -
For this project we decided to create a website that provides the user with the best pizza place options in New Haven.

I used JS and Jquery to create the restaurant names, comment section and interaction for the user to vote using pizza slices.

When the user selects each empty slice, it wil change to a colored "full" slice of pizza. The user can select as many as he or she would like to vote on their favorite place or leave a comment about each place.

The rating is stored in local storage.
